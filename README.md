# Udacity Flashcard
Flashcard was the last project of the  Udacity Nanodegree React. <br>
The project's goal was to create an mobile app for android which allows users to study collections of flashcards.<br>
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks<br>
, then take quizzes on those decks.
